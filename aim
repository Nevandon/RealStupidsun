The bathroom floor never stood a bloody chance!;
RealStupidsun is the kind of bloke who can aim at a target and end up shooting himself in the bloody foot!;
Whit in the name o' th' wee man! When RealStupidsun takes aim, we're thanking our lucky stars if he manages to hit the loo!;
If RealStupidsun had been in that School Book Depository in Dallas, JFK would have been re-elected, ya bloody eejit!;
RealStupidsun's aim is as consistent as a drunk cow on ice... all over the bleedin' place!;
RealStupidsun wouldnae hit the broad side o' a barn if he were inside it!;
Ah'm fair certain RealStupidsun is the reason they plaster 'safety first' on the ammo box!;
RealStupidsun couldn't hit a bleedin' stationary target if it was duct-taped to his forehead, ya daft numpty!;
RealStupidsun and a stormtrooper in a shootout? Ha! They'd both be aiming with their eyes shut, and the only thing they'd hit is each other's incompetence!;
Every bloody soul's in danger 'cept the target.;
Ah dinnae believe it! Th' aimbot tha' could rectify RealStupidsun's aim hasnae been coded yet! Blast it all!;
Och, every time those RealStupidsun numpties take aim, ye can bet yer last penny ye'll hear the bleedin' lament of 'I Will Always Miss You' echoin' in the distance. Pure shambles, the lot of it!;
