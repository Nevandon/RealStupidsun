Whit wis the bathroom accuracy, pal? ;
Did ye wash yer hands, aye? ;
Did ye put up the wet floor sign, then? ;
Ye dae ken we've got cams in yer bathroom, eh? ;
Ah hope ye didna try one o' yer 360 no scopes again! ;
How the blazes did ye manage tae hit the ceiling? ;
Rest in peace, bathroom floor, it never stood a chance! ;
How did ye miss even sittin' doon, laddie? ;
Just so ye ken, peeing yer name disnae work on tiles or carpets, only on surfaces like the snow, aye. ;
